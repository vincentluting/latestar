Hello, I’m Vincent Lu, and I’ve been living in the Netherlands for almost ten years. These years in a multicultural environment have deepened my understanding of the importance of emotional connection and communication. I truly believe that technology is more than just a tool—it can be a warm, guiding force that helps us move toward a more complete sense of self.

My vision is to create an AI platform centered on emotional intelligence, dedicated to mental healing and career guidance. I hope this platform can offer gentle support and companionship to each user in their busy lives, helping them understand themselves better, find their career paths, and live with greater meaning. I am convinced that with the help of technology, healing and growth can become experiences within everyone’s reach.

At the same time, I hope to use the power of marketing to build emotional bridges between brands and users, helping Chinese companies expand internationally or providing cultural support for European and American companies entering the Chinese market. Effective marketing doesn’t just convey information; it brings brands into the hearts of users, creating genuine resonance. My goal is to leverage the advantages of emotional intelligence technology to help businesses become trusted partners in people’s lives across diverse cultural environments.

Throughout this journey, I am also enthusiastic about becoming a career coach for some people, listening to their stories, offering encouragement, and helping them find their own direction. I know that everyone is moving forward on their unique path to meaning and growth, and if I can offer a bit of support and encouragement along the way, that would be my greatest reward.

Here, I’ll share my reflections on emotional intelligence, AI, marketing, and cross-cultural communication. I hope these thoughts provide inspiration, allowing us to support each other and walk this path of growth together.
