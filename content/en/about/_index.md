Hello, I’m Vincent Lu, currently living in the Netherlands for almost 10 years. These years in a multicultural environment have deepened my understanding of the importance of emotional connection and communication. I truly believe that technology is more than just a tool—it can be a warm, guiding force that helps us move toward a more complete self.

My vision is to create an AI platform focused on emotional intelligence, dedicated to mental healing and career guidance. I hope this platform can offer gentle support and companionship to users in their busy lives, helping them understand themselves better, find their career paths, and lead more meaningful lives. With the help of technology, I believe healing and growth can be within reach for everyone.

At the same time, I aspire to use the power of marketing to build emotional bridges between brands and their users, supporting Chinese companies in expanding internationally, or helping European and American businesses enter the Chinese market. Effective marketing doesn’t just convey information; it brings brands into the hearts of their users, creating genuine resonance. My goal is to leverage emotional intelligence technology to help businesses become trusted partners in people’s lives across diverse cultural environments.

Along this journey, I’m also enthusiastic about being a guide and supporter for those around me, listening to their stories and helping them find their own directions. I know each person is on their unique path toward meaning and growth, and if I can offer some support or encouragement along the way, that would be my greatest reward.

Here, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on emotional intelligence, AI, marketing, and cross-cultural communication. I hope these reflections bring some inspiration, allowing us to support each other and walk this path of growth together.
