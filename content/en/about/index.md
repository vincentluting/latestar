Hi everyone, I’m Vincent. I’ve been calling the Netherlands home for nearly nine years, and this journey has been transformative in ways I never anticipated. Moving here from China was a leap into the unknown, but it taught me so much about what it means to connect with people on a deeper level. Navigating new cultures, ideas, and ways of working really opened my eyes to the power of understanding different perspectives—and it fueled my passion for helping people and brands connect across cultural lines in a way that feels real.

In my work, I’ve had the opportunity to help brands reach audiences in new markets, using data and technology to create connections that go beyond surface-level interactions. I believe brand promotion isn’t just about being seen; it’s about being understood and building trust. Every brand has a story, and it’s incredibly fulfilling to help those stories resonate in a way that genuinely matters to people.

I’m especially fascinated by how technology and AI can give us new insights into what makes audiences tick. There’s something powerful about taking raw data and uncovering the human patterns within it—finding the trends and stories that allow us to create marketing that feels thoughtful and personal. I believe that tech, when used with intention, can help us connect with people on their terms, meeting them where they are.

Outside of my day-to-day work, I’ve started coaching a few people on their career journeys, focusing on growth and leadership. It’s been one of the most rewarding parts of my week, reminding me of how important it is to feel supported as we navigate our paths. I’ve been fortunate to have mentors who believed in me, and I’m grateful to now pay it forward. If career growth, finding your voice, or leadership is something you’re exploring, feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat.

Here, I’ll be sharing thoughts on market strategy, technology’s role in marketing, and the art of connecting across cultures. I hope these insights are helpful, and I look forward to connecting with others who are curious about building a future in tech, marketing, and meaningful brand connections.
