Hello, everyone. I’m Vincent Lu, and I’ve lived in the Netherlands for nearly a decade. Immersed in a multicultural environment, I’ve developed a deep understanding of cross-cultural communication, emotional insight, and the intersection of technology with human connection. Over the years, I’ve been dedicated to exploring how market promotion and emotional intelligence technology can provide brands with emotionally resonant solutions, enabling them to be more competitive and appealing in cross-cultural markets.

I focus on leveraging data-driven emotional intelligence and market insights to align a brand’s unique value with the inner needs of its audience. For European and American companies looking to enter the Chinese market, I provide not only strategic guidance but also in-depth cultural support. For Chinese companies, I help them bridge cultural gaps and reach broader international markets. Real brand promotion is not just about conveying information—it’s about creating emotional resonance and making the brand a trusted partner in users’ lives.

I also enjoy working alongside companies to explore new breakthroughs in employee career development and leadership building. My aim is to be a long-term partner in motivating employee growth and strengthening internal communication and collaboration.

Here, I will share my insights on emotional intelligence, market promotion, and cross-cultural communication to help companies thrive in complex, diverse markets. I hope these reflections inspire others, and I look forward to collaborating with more companies to explore the vast potential of technology and marketing together.
