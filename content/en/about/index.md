Hi everyone, I’m Vincent. I’ve been living in the Netherlands for almost nine years now, and working in such a diverse environment has really deepened my appreciation for cross-cultural communication and understanding. I’m passionate about exploring how we can bring together technology and human connection to make brands feel more relatable and impactful.

In my work, I focus on helping brands connect emotionally with their audiences by using data-driven insights and a strong understanding of what really matters to people. For European and American companies wanting to enter the Chinese market, I offer not just strategic guidance but cultural insights that make a real difference. And for Chinese brands, I help them bridge the cultural divide to reach global audiences. I believe that true brand promotion goes beyond just sharing information—it’s about creating genuine resonance and making brands a trusted part of people’s lives.

I’m also very interested in helping companies support their employees in their career growth and leadership development. For me, it’s all about fostering collaboration and building an environment where people feel motivated and connected.

Here, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on emotional intelligence, market promotion, and navigating the complexities of cross-cultural communication. I hope these insights will be useful, and I look forward to working with companies that want to explore new possibilities in tech and marketing.
