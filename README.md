## How to make a new webpage

Content is written in Markdown files. There are tons of guides out there for Markdown formatting.
Assuming you want to add showcase a new Coding Club project:

1. Create 'project-name.md' in `content/projects`
2. Add metadata at the top of the file as shown in 'sample.md'
3. If your local server is running, saving should automatically update the site. You'll find your new webpage inside Projects.
